# Auto Trend Lines
Auto Trend Lines is a Pine script for TradingView that automatically draws trend lines on a price chart based on the current and previous high and low values.

## Installation
To use the Auto Trend Lines script in TradingView, follow these steps:

1. Open a new chart in TradingView.
2. Click on the "Pine Editor" button at the bottom of the chart.
3. Copy and paste the Auto Trend Lines Pine script into the Pine Editor.
4. Click on the "Add to Chart" button to apply the script to the chart.
## Usage
The Auto Trend Lines script calculates trend lines based on the past 500 bars, but you can modify the `for` loop to use a different time period or use a different calculation method based on your trading strategy.

The script draws both uptrend and downtrend lines automatically on the chart, with the ability to extend the lines to the right and left edges of the chart using the `extend=extend.both` parameter.
